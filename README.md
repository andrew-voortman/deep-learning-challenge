# REPORT ON NEURAL NETWORK MODEL

### Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Process
Utilize the following steps to compile, train and evaluate a neural network model:

1. Preprocess the Data
2. Compile, train and evaluate a neural network model
3. Optimize the Model by adjusting any of the following:
    * Dropping more or fewer columns.
    * Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
    * Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
    * Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
    * Add more hidden layers.
    * Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
    * Add or reduce the number of epochs to the training regimen.

### Report
1. **Overview**: The purpose of this analysis is to help Alphabit Soup predict whether applicants will be successful if funded. This will help it determine the most likely applicants to succeed and act accordingly.

2. **Results**: 

* Data Preprocessing
  * Target variable:  IS_SUCCESSFUL
  * Feature variables:
      * APPLICATION_TYPE 

      * AFFILIATION
      
      * CLASSIFICATION
      
      * USE_CASE
      
      * ORGANIZATION
      
      * STATUS
      
      * INCOME_AMT
      
      * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
      
      * ASK_AMT
  * Removed variables:
      
      * EIN
      
      * NAME

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

3. **Summary**: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
